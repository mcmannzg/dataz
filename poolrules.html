		<h3>Pool Rules</h3>
		<p>This page is to clarify the rules of 8-Ball Pool, as described by the American Pool Association.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="apapoolrules">
		<p>General Description - 8-Ball is played with a cue ball
			and normal rack of fifteen (15) object balls. The purpose
			of this game is for one player to pocket the solid balls
			numbered from 1 to 7 or the striped balls numbered
			from 9 to 15, and then marking and pocketing the 8-ball
			before his opponent. Choice of balls to be pocketed is
			made by the player legally pocketing the first ball of the
			game.
			<br><br>
			1. Lag - Method used to start a match. Players
			simultaneously shoot a ball from behind the head string,
			banking it off the foot rail and back to the head of the
			table. Striking the side rails or any pocket results in loss
			of the lag. The closest ball to the head rail wins. It is
			permissible to strike the head rail. If the lagged balls
			make contact during the lag, re-lag.
			<br><br>
			2. Racking - All balls should be frozen (touching) as
			tightly as possible. Balls are racked with the front ball
			on the foot spot and the 8-ball in the center. The
			breaking player may request and receive a rerack.
			<br><br>
			3. Breaking - To be a legal break, players must break
			from behind the head string. The head ball or second
			ball must be struck first and at least four object balls
			must be driven to the rails or a ball must be pocketed.
			The cue ball may not be shot into a rail before the rack.
			If the break does not qualify as legal, the balls are
			reracked and rebroken by the same player. If the break
			does not qualify as legal and results in a scratch, the
			balls are reracked and broken by the opposite player.
			<br><br>
			THE RACK MUST BE STRUCK BEFORE A FOUL CAN
			OCCUR. Breaking safe or soft is not allowed. The League
			Operator may make judgments and issue penalties to
			teams and players who are not breaking hard. Breaking
			just hard enough to comply with this rule is not a
			guarantee against penalties. Remember, break as hard as
			you can with control
			<br><br>
			4. After the Break - Various circumstances can occur
			upon completion of the break. They are:
			<br>
			a. A foul on a legal break results in ball-in-hand
			behind the head string and the incoming player
			may shoot any ball outside the head string (see
			diagram of table in Team Manual for explanation).
			A ball that's dead center or "out" is playable. If it
			is "in", the ball is not playable. It is up to the
			opponent to call the cue ball "in" before it is shot.
			(See Team Manual for a more complete
			explanation.)
			<br>
			b. No balls are pocketed and it is the other player's
			turn.
			<br>
			c. The 8-ball is pocketed. This is a win, unless the
			player scratches, in which case he loses.
			<br>
			d. One ball is pocketed; it is still the breaker's
			turn and he continues shooting the category of
			balls he just made.
			<br>
			e. One ball of each category is pocketed. The breaker
			has his choice of balls. He may shoot any ball,
			except the 8-ball (which would be a foul), and
			each pocketed ball counts. If he makes one of each
			category on his second shot, he still has an "open
			table." If he misses or fouls on his second shot, his
			opponent has an "open table." "Open table" means
			a player can shoot a combination involving a stripe
			and a solid and whichever he makes, without
			committing a foul, would be his category.
			<br>
			f. If two balls of one category and one ball of
			the other category are pocketed, it is the shooter's
			choice just as in "e" above.
			<br>
			g. Occasionally it occurs that a player mistakenly
			starts shooting the wrong category of balls.
			Although it is sportsmanlike for the sitting player
			to remind the shooting player that he is about to
			foul by shooting the wrong category of balls, it is
			not a requirement for him to do so. Once the
			shooter has hit the wrong category of balls, the
			foul has occurred whether the ball is pocketed or
			not. If the ball is pocketed, it is permissible,
			though not recommended, that the sitting player
			allow the shooting player to continue shooting his
			balls in until he feels inclined to call the foul. The
			shooting player can escape penalty by quietly
			realizing his error and returning to shoot the
			correct category of balls and legally contacting one
			of them before his opponent calls foul, or by
			finishing off the wrong category of balls and
			legally contacting the 8-ball prior to his opponent
			calling a foul. In other words, the sitting player
			must call the foul before the shooter returns to the 
			correct category and legally contacts one or before
			the shooter pockets the remaining balls of the
			wrong category and legally contacts the 8-ball.
			Once a player makes legal contact with the 8-ball,
			the player assumes control of that category of
			wrongly pocketed balls and can win the game by
			pocketing the 8-ball. In addition, if the sitting
			player does not call a foul before his opponent’s
			turn ends, and subsequently contacts the wrong
			category himself, both players will assume the
			new category of balls for the remainder of the
			game. Before any foul has occurred, the shooter
			also may avoid penalty by asking the sitting
			player which category of balls he has. The sitting
			player must tell him the truth.
			<br><br>
			5. Combination Shots - Combination shots are legal,
			but striking the correct ball first is required except in an
			"open table" situation. The 8-ball is not neutral. A
			player is credited with all balls he legally pockets.
			When a player does not pocket one of his balls but
			pockets an opponent's ball, he loses his turn. The
			opponent gets credit for the pocketed ball. No pocketed
			ball is ever spotted.
			<br><br>
			6. Balls on the Floor - If the 8-ball is knocked on the
			floor, it is loss of game. Object balls knocked on the
			floor are spotted. If the spot is taken, the ball is placed
			on a line directly behind the spot as close as possible.
			Knocking a ball other than the cue ball on the floor is
			not a foul. It might occur that a player pockets his ball
			while simultaneously knocking another ball on the floor.
			In this situation, it is still his turn and the ball is
			 not spotted until he misses. If the ball on the floor is one of
			the shooter's balls, it is spotted when the shooter has
			pocketed all of his other balls or misses.
			<br><br>
			7. Pocketed Balls - Balls must remain in a pocket to be
			legal. If a ball goes in a pocket, but bounces back onto
			the playing surface, it is not considered pocketed. If it is
			the 8-ball, it is not considered either a win or loss. If it
			is the cue ball, it is not considered a scratch.
			<br><br>
			8. One Foot on the Floor - While shooting, at least one
			foot must be on the floor at all times if a bridge is
			available. There is no foul—simply stop the shooter and
			hand him the bridge. League Management cannot
			guarantee the presence of bridges and some Host
			Locations may not have them.
			Exception: Players shooting from a wheelchair must
			remain seated in their wheelchair while shooting.
			<br><br>
			9. Fouls - If any of the following fouls are committed, the
			penalty is ball-in-hand for the incoming player. Make
			certain you have ball-in-hand before you touch the cue ball
			by confirming with your opponent. Ball-in-hand means
			you are allowed to place the cue ball anywhere on the
			table (with the exception of a scratch on the break which
			results in ball-in-hand behind the head string) and shoot any
			of your balls (or the 8, if all of your category of balls have
			been pocketed). Even after having addressed the cue ball,
			a player may, if not satisfied with the placement, make
			further adjustments with the hand, cue stick or any other
			reasonable piece of equipment. A foul may be called only
			if the player fouls while actually stroking at the cue ball,
			meaning a double hit of the cue ball (sometimes called
			double clutching). The ball-in-hand rule penalizes a player
			for an error. Without this rule, a player could benefit by
			accidentally or purposely scratching or otherwise fouling.
			<br><br>
			ONLY THE PLAYER OR THE TEAM CAPTAIN
			MAY OFFICIALLY CALL A FOUL although anyone may
			suggest to the player or the team captain that a foul
			should be called.
