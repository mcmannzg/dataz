		<h3>Astronomy</h3>
		<p>Everything that I learn about astronomy will be put on this page, starting with what I learn from the quizlets on astronomy, to the actual astronomy course in spring 2019.</p>

		<h3>Kepler's Laws</h3>
			<p>Kepler's First Law: The orbits of the planets are ellipses with the Sun at one foci (nearly circular)</p>
			<p>Kepler's Second Law: The line between a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times.</p>
			<p>Kepler's Third Law: The square of orbital period increases with cube of semimajor axis. (Planets farther from the sun move more slowly)</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Newton's Laws</h3>
			<p>Newton's First Law: In the absence of force, objects move in a straight line.</p>
			<p>Newton's Second Law: Force equals mass times acceleration. (The definition of force or F=MA)
			<p>Newton's Third Law: For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.</p>
			<p>Newton's "Fourth Law": Gravity is universal, and cannot extend undiluted forever.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Assorted Notes</h3>
			<p>When the moon passes in front of the sun, a solar eclipse occurs.</p>
			<p>The North Celestial Pole is the location on the celestial sphere directly above the Earth's northern rotation pole.</p>
			<p>The Saros Cycle lasts 18 years and 11 days, and is used to predict solar eclipses.</p>
			<p>The astronomical unit is the unit of length used for distances within the solar system.</p>
			<p>Sirius is the brightest star in the sky.</p>
			<p>The Zenith is the point in the sky directly overhead, or the highest point.</p>
