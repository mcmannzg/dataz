		<h3>Future Business Plans</h3>
		<p>All of my future business ideas will be held on this page. Everything that I think could be a successful future startup will be here.</p>

		<h3>Go-Karting Business</h3>
		<p>Startup Cost: ~$1.5 million USD</p>
		<p>Potential Gross Monthly Profit: ~$324,000 USD</p>
		<p>Startup Cost Paid off in: 4.63 Months</p>
		<p>General Idea: Charge $15 per race, have a maximum of 10 people in each race. Each race should take ~10 minutes, making the profit per race a maximum of $150. There can be 6 races per hour, meaning the hourly profit would be $900. If there were 6 employees working at any given time, and they are paid ~$12/hour, the employee cost per hour would be just $72. Electricity and water costs are unknown, however, it would not be more than $50/hour. This means that the net profit per hour would still be ~$778. A warehouse of the size of a go-karting business would undoubtedly have a hefty property tax each month, which has not been taken into account. Overall, the only hurdle would be the startup cost, because it is so massive. However, once the business is started, it is potentially extremely profitable.</p>
